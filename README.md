# NumRu (NumPy in Ruby)

NumRu is adoption of NumPy in Ruby. The aim is not just to port NumPy to Ruby but to adopt it to Ruby syntax and ease.

## Installation

1. You need Python 2 for this to work. It uses `rubypython` which currently only works for Python 2 but work is underway to make it work for Python 3.

2. Install `numpy` package for Python.

3. Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'numru'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install NumRu

## Usage

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
